# Pokedex
iOS Pokedex that I created for my iPhone 6s using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)<br>
I'm frequently working to polish app functionality and add new features<br>

Current version includes<br>
- Scrollable dex with sprites<br>
- Appearance shifting based on pokemon type<br>
- Type effectiveness<br>
- Base stats<br>

Working on <br>
- Moves<br>
- Advanced Search<br>
- Alternate sprites (shiny + regional forms)<br>
- Gen 7 + 8 <br>
